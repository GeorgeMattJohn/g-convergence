Questions:

How are we going to implement processing requests from the Convergence
clients which connect to the notary server?

We will use pthreads.

Can C work with SQL database? Which one do we want to use? Which libraries
does C provide that we could use?

Yes, C does work with SQL database. Tentatively, We are going to use sqlite
which should be relatively easy to work with. 

Next steps:

* Set up a Git repository
* Learn more about pthreads.
* Find a sqlite database library for C
